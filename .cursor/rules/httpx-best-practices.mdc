# Best practices for using httpx in asynchronous HTTP requests

- Use `async with` for managing client sessions to ensure proper resource cleanup
- Implement proper timeout settings to prevent hanging requests
- Use `httpx.AsyncClient` for concurrent requests to improve performance
- Handle exceptions gracefully, especially `httpx.HTTPError`
- Utilize streaming for large payloads to manage memory efficiently
- Set appropriate headers for authentication and content type
