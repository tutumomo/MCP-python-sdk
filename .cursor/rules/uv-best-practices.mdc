# Best practices for managing Python projects with uv

- Use `uv init` to set up new projects quickly
- Manage dependencies with `uv add` to ensure reproducibility
- Use virtual environments with `uv venv` to isolate project dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies with `uv update` to maintain security and performance
- Use `uv run` to execute scripts within the correct environment context
