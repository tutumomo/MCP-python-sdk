# Best practices and guidelines for Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- Use `FastMCP` for simpler server implementations
- Implement tools with clear descriptions and type annotations
- Utilize `Sampling` for user interaction before executing critical operations
- Leverage lifecycle hooks for managing resources and logging
- Ensure proper error handling and logging in tools
- Use `stdio` transport for local development and `sse` for cloud deployment
- Implement caching mechanisms using lifecycle context for performance optimization
