# Best practices for integrating OpenAI API

- Use environment variables to manage API keys securely
- Implement rate limiting to avoid hitting API limits
- Use the `tools` parameter to guide model behavior effectively
- Handle API responses robustly, including error cases
- Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Use streaming responses for real-time applications to improve user experience
